## Requirements
Each provided programming language lives in its own directory. Each directy needs its own `README.md`. This file needs to have an explanation on how to get the provided code up and running. This does not mean, that you need to copy basic language tutorials. A link to an appropriate guide is sufficent.

The running code needs to output `Pizza Day!` to the console, if it's executed on a Friday. Any non-Friday should print `:(` into the console.
